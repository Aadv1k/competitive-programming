# Competitive Programming

> The solutions here can range from any language which I am working with at the moment, and these solutions are largely meant to be "mirrors" so I don't set up tests for it

## Introduction 

Competitive programming has always been a bit of a wonder to me, as an outsider seeing programmers rapidly typing away at a solution before I could even understand the problem was, fascinating. It invoked a similar feeling of awe and disconnect I felt seeing chess grandmasters (still not good at chess) 

I've decided to get better at this sport, for two reasons, the first being that is is fun, I had a blast doing [Advent Of Code](https://github.com/aadv1k/AdventOfGo2023) so I might try to actively practice and spend time doing this. Second reason, if I am going to have to do coding interviews, I might as well have some fun preparing for them.
